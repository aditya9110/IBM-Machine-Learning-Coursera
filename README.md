# Disclaimer
I feel that one should not upload the same notebooks from repository for submissions, rather consider a dataset that triggers you and work on it to get understanding of the things. If you didn't understand any section of the project, you can refer to my work for better explanation. They are meant to unblock you if you get stuck somewhere. The instructions of the project are straight-forward and well structured.
